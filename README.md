# About

Create Crafts & Additions extends Create and acts as a bridge between electricity and kinetic energy from Create by adding an Electric Motor which generates kinetic energy from Forge energy and an Alternator which does the opposite at 75% efficency. To crafts these items you need to make a Rolling Mill which is a kinetic machine that is used to make rods and wires. All the recipes are available through JEI.
